      Rally Badminton: </h1>
      <p>
        Rally badminton, also known as singles badminton, is a popular sport
        played between two individuals. Each player stands on opposite sides of
        a rectangular court divided by a net, and the objective is to hit a
        shuttlecock over the net and land it on the opponent's side. Players use
        rackets to hit the shuttlecock, and the game involves a series of rapid
        back-and-forth exchanges, known as rallies. The winner is the player who
        wins the best of three sets, with each set being played until one player
        reaches 21 points.

    <h1>Solo Badminton:</h1>
      <p>
        Solo badminton, also known as individual badminton, is a form of
        badminton where players play alone against a wall or a machine that
        sends shuttlecocks back to them. This is often used for training
        purposes, as it helps players to develop their hand-eye coordination,
        footwork, and overall agility. In solo badminton, players can focus on
        specific aspects of their game without having to worry about their
        opponent's tactics or strategy.

      <h1>Doubles Badminton:</h1> </p>Doubles badminton is a popular form of badminton played
      between two teams of two players each. The objective of the game is
      similar to singles badminton, with the aim being to hit the shuttlecock
      over the net and onto the opponent's side of the court. However, doubles
      badminton requires players to work together in order to win points, with
      each team member covering specific areas of the court. The game involves
      fast-paced exchanges and requires players to be quick on their feet and
      have excellent communication skills. The team that wins the best of three
      sets, with each set being played until one team reaches 21 points, is
      declared the winner.</p>
